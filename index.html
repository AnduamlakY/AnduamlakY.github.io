										<h2><a href="#">Project 1:Exploratory data analytics on Sales data</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>The purpose of this project was to perform exploratory Data Analytics(EDA) using a real world sales data to perform the following tasks:
									     # 1. What is the best month for sales? How much it was earned ?
                                         # 2. Which city had the highest number of sales?
                                         # 3. What time should we display advertisment to maximize the liklihood of customer for buying products?
                                         # 4. what products are most often sold together?
                                         # 5. Segregate/Classify all the products with expensive product,mid range product and cheapest ones?
                                         # 6. How much percentage more expensive is "#Macbook Pro Laptop" when compared to all products?

										<h2><a href="#">Project 4:Scraping Women sunglass data from https://www.sunglasshut.com</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>The purpose of this project was to scrape sunglass data’s from https://www.sunglasshut.com/, 
mainly women’s sunglass information is required with the following data columns: sunglass 
Name, Sunglass Model, Sunglass Price, Sunglass Size and Sunglass Color . A total of 1 to 20 page 
sizes are scrapped with 18 pages of data, resulting in a 365 x 5 matrix. 
I’ve first investigated the website by first check the elements with “Inspect” and see how the 
required data are tagged with which HTML tag element. I’ve selected Beautiful Soup and Requests 
libraries of python to scrap this website as there is no hidden API Json file available in network 
monitor tab of internet browsers. All the required information is linked with other page using 
header reference attributes so that I’ve partitioned my python code with three modules, the first 
one will parse the href for getting sunglass product information and pass this value to the second 
function to parse sunglass data. The third module is the main function to call the two defined 
functions by setting page limit sizes. I could able to retrieve all the required data by using the 
sleep function to stop the request for 3-14 seconds and then resume it. This helps the server to 
avoid being overloaded by iteratively modifying the request pattern. To avoid being prevented 
from accessing the website, I used also Change User Agent with request library to change the 
default User Agent.
The project is completed by achieving the desired goal with transformed data values, despite the 
fact that bypassing the website's security feature is difficult in and of itself. However, using the 
techniques described above, I have able to bypass the security feature and retrieve the total number 
of required instances.

										<h2><a href="#">Project 5:Scraping Amazon Website to scrap SQL Book Data</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/amazon.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The project's goal was to scrape SQL book data from https://www.amazon.com/ using data fields with four properties. Book Name, Published Date, rating out of 5 and Global Ratings are the columns. The data was scraped from 1 to 20 different page sizes, resulting in a 263 x 4 matrix.
I began my investigation of the website by using "Inspect" to examine the elements and observe how the required data is tagged with which HTML tag element. I chose the Python Modules Beautiful Soup and Requests to scrape this website since they are extremely quick at downloading the data content i needed in a short period of time. I always use a technique for sending requests to the targeted server that involves delaying the request for a certain amount of time and then altering the request pattern by stopping the request for 10-20 seconds and then restarting it using the sleep and randint routines. This allows me to scrape data iteratively with several sites without being blocked by the server.
The project was completed by achieving the desired goal with cleaned data values, despite the fact that bypassing the website's security feature of Amazon is difficult in and of itself. However, using the techniques described above, I was able to bypass the security feature and retrieve the total number of required data.
